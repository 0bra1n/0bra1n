# 🖖 Hey dev! Welcome to my profile <img align="right" src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Fcksean&style=flat-square&color=blueviolet">

I'm a front-end developer!

I've been working and studying technology since 2020, and during this time I worked with diverse types of projects like web programming

What made me fall in love with web development and front-end is the capability to create interfaces and in some kind make art, when developing I feel like I'm making art with coding.
